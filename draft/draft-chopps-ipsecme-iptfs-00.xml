<section title="Introduction" anchor="org7d13858">
<t>Traffic Analysis (<xref target="RFC4301"/>, <xref target="AppCrypt"/>) is the act of extracting
information about data being sent through a network. While one may
directly obscure the data through the use of encryption <xref target="RFC4303"/>,
the traffic pattern itself exposes information due to variations in
it's shape and timing (<xref target="I-D.iab-wire-image"/>, <xref target="AppCrypt"/>).
Hiding the size and frequency of traffic is referred to as Traffic
Flow Confidentiality (TFC) <xref target="RFC4303"/>.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4303"/> provides for TFC by allowing padding to be added to the
encrypted IP packets and allowing for sending all-pad packets
(protocol 59). This method has the major limitation that it can
significantly under-utilize the available bandwidth.</t>

<t>The IP-TFS solution provides for full TFC without the aforementioned
bandwidth limitation. To do this we use a constant send rate IPsec
<xref target="RFC4303"/> tunnel with fixed-sized encapsulating packets; however,
these fixed-sized packets can contain partial, full or multiple IP
packets to maximize the bandwidth of the tunnel.</t>

<t>Additionally, IP-TFS provides for dealing with network congestion
<xref target="RFC2914"/>. This is important for when the IP-TFS user is not in full
control of the domain through which the IP-TFS tunnel path flows.</t>

<t>The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

<t>This document assumes familiarity with IP security concepts described

<section title="The IP-TFS Tunnel" anchor="org7227ee6">
<t>As mentioned in <xref target="org7d13858"/> IP-TFS utilizes an IPsec <xref target="RFC4303"/>
tunnel as it's transport. To provide for full TFC we send fixed sized
encapsulating packets at a constant rate on the tunnel.</t>

<t>The primary input to the tunnel algorithm is the requested bandwidth
of the tunnel. From this we must determine the size and rate of the
fixed sized packets we will send on the tunnel.</t>

<t>The fixed-packet-size may either be specified manually or can be
determined optimally through the use of Path MTU discovery <xref target="RFC1191"/>
and <xref target="RFC8201"/>.</t>

<t>Given the encapsulating packet size and the requested tunnel
bandwidth we determine the correct packet send rate. The packet send
rate is the requested bandwidth divided by the payload size of the
fixed-packet-size encapsulating packet.</t>

<t>The egress of the IP-TFS tunnel SHOULD NOT impose any restrictions on
tunnel packet size or arrival rate. Packet size and send rate is
entirely the function of the ingress (sending) side of the IP-TFS
tunnel. Indeed, the ingress (sending) side of the IP-TFS tunnel MUST
be allowed to vary the size and rate at which it sends encapsulating
packets, including sending them larger, smaller, faster or slower
than the requested size and rate.</t>

<section title="Tunnel Content" anchor="org5ae31f8">
<t>As previously mentioned, one issue with the TFC padding solution in
<xref target="RFC4303"/> is the large amount of wasted bandwidth as only one IP
packet can be sent per encapsulating packet. In order to maximize
bandwidth IP-TFS breaks this one-to-one association.</t>

<t>With IP-TFS we fragment as well as aggregate the inner IP traffic
flow into the encapsulating IP tunnel packets. We only pad the tunnel
packets if there is no data available to be sent at the time of
tunnel packet transmission.</t>

<t>In order to do this we create a new payload data type identified with
a new IP protocol number IPTFS_PROTOCOL (TBD). A payload of
IPTFS_PROTOCOL type is comprised of a 32 bit header followed by
either a partial, a full or multiple partial or full data-blocks.</t>

<t>The BlockOffset value is either zero or some offset into or past the
end of the data blocks payload data. If the value is zero it means
that a new data-block immediately follows the fixed header (i.e., the
BlockOffset value). Conversely if the BlockOffset value is non-zero
it points at the start of the next data block. It can be the case
that the BlockOffset points past the end of the data block payload
data. This simply means that the next data-block occurs in a
subsequent encapsulating packet. When the BlockOffset is non-zero the
data immediately following the header belongs to the previous
data-block that is still being re-assembled.</t>

<t>The V (version) bit is included for future compatibility.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>A data-block is defined by a 4-bit type code followed by the data
block data. The types values have been carefully chosen to coincide
with the IPv4/IPv6 version field values so that no per-data-block
type overhead is required to encapsulate an IP packet. Likewise, the
length of the data block is extracted from the encapsulated IPv4 or
IPv6 packet's length field.</t>

</section>

<section title="No Implicit Padding" anchor="org854550c">
<t>It's worth noting that there is no need for implicit pads at the end
of an encapsulating packet. Even when the start of a data block
occurs near the end of a encapsulating packet such that there is no
room for the length field of the encapsulated header to be included
in the current encapsulating packet, the fact that the length comes
at a known location and as is guaranteed to be present is enough to
fetch the length field from the subsequent encapsulating packet
payload.</t>

</section>

<section title="IP Header Value Mapping" anchor="orgd8f4691">
<t><xref target="RFC4301"/> provides some direction on when and how to map various
values from an inner IP header to the outer encapsulating header,
namely the Don't-Fragment (DF) bit (<xref target="RFC0791"/> and <xref target="RFC8200"/>), the
Differentiated Services (DS) field <xref target="RFC2474"/> and the Explicit
Congestion Notification (ECN) field <xref target="RFC3168"/>. Unlike <xref target="RFC4301"/> with
IP-TFS we may and often will be encapsulating more than 1 IP packet
per ESP packet. To deal with this we further restrict these mappings.
In particular we never map the inner DF bit as it is unrelated to the
IP-TFS tunnel functionality; we never directly fragment the inner
packets and the inner packets will not affect the fragmentation of
the outer encapsulation packets. Likewise, the ECN value need not be
mapped as any congestion related to the constant send rate IP-TFS
tunnel is unrelated (by design!) to the inner traffic flow. Finally,
by default the DS field should not be copied although an
implementation may choose to allow for configuration to override this
behavior. An implementation SHOULD also allow the DS value to be set
by configuration.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Exclusive SA Use" anchor="org6381886">
<t>It is not the intention of this specification to allow for mixed use
of an IPsec SA. In other words, an SA that is created for IP-TFS is
exclusively for IP-TFS use and MUST NOT have non-IP-TFS payloads such
as IP (IP protocol 4) or TCP transport (IP protocol 6) intermixed
with IP-TFS (IP protocol TBD) payloads. While it's possible to
envision making the algorithm work in the presence of sequence number
skips in the IP-TFS payload stream, the added complexity is not
deemed worthwhile. Other IPsec uses can configure and use their own
SAs.</t>

</section>

<section title="Initiation of TFS mode" anchor="org48ca3d1">
<t>While normally a user will configure their IPsec tunnel to operate in
IP-TFS mode to start, we also allow IP-TFS mode to be enabled post-SA
creation. This may be useful for debugging or other purposes. In this
late enabled mode the receiver would switch to IP-TFS mode on receipt
of the first ESP payload with the IPTFS_PROTOCOL indicated as the
payload type.</t>

</section>

<section title="Example of an encapsulated IP packet flow" anchor="org8fe7884">
<t>Below we show an example inner IP packet flow within the
encapsulating tunnel packet stream. Notice how encapsulated IP
packets can start and end anywhere, and more than one or less than 1
may occur in a single encapsulating packet.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[

 Offset: 0        Offset: 100    Offset: 2900    Offset: 1400
[ ESP1  (1500) ][ ESP2  (1500) ][ ESP3  (1500) ][ ESP4  (1500) ]
[--800--][--800--][60][-240-][--4000----------------------][pad]

]]></artwork></figure>


<t>The encapsulated IP packet flow (lengths include IP header and
payload) is as follows: an 800 octet packet, an 800 octet packet, a 60
octet packet, a 240 octet packet, a 4000 octet packet.</t>

<t>The BlockOffset values in the 4 IP-TFS payload headers for this
packet flow would thus be: 0, 100, 2900, 1400 respectively. The first
encapsulating packet ESP1 has a zero BlockOffset which points at the
IP data block immediately following the IP-TFS header. The following
packet ESP2s BlockOffset points inward 100 octets to the start of the
60 octet data block. The third encapsulating packet ESP3 contains the
middle portion of the 4000 octet data block so the offset points past
its end and into the forth encapsulating packet. The fourth packet
ESP4s offset is 1400 pointing at the padding which follows the
completion of the continued 4000 octet packet.</t>

<t>Having the BlockOffset always point at the next available data block
allows for quick recovery with minimal inner packet loss in the
presence of outer encapsulating packet loss.</t>

</section>

<section title="Modes of operation" anchor="org6b090f9">
<t>Just as with normal IPsec tunnels IP-TFS tunnels are unidirectional.
Bidirectional functionality is achieved by setting up 2 tunnels, one
in either direction.</t>

<t>An IP-TFS tunnel can operate in 2 modes, a non-congestion controlled
mode and congestion controlled mode.</t>

<section title="Non-Congestion Controlled Mode" anchor="orga45a7a5">
<t>In the non-congestion controlled mode IP-TFS sends fixed-sized
packets at a constant rate. The packet send rate is constant and is
not automatically adjusted regardless of any network congestion
(i.e., packet loss).</t>

<t>For similar reasons as given in <xref target="RFC7510"/> the non-congestion
controlled mode should only be used where the user has full
administrative control over the path the tunnel will take. This is
required so the user can guarantee the bandwidth and also be sure as
to not be negatively affecting network congestion <xref target="RFC2914"/>. In this
case packet loss should be reported to the administrator (e.g.,
via syslog, YANG notification, SNMP traps, etc) so that any
failures due to a lack of bandwidth can be corrected.</t>

</section>

<section title="Congestion Controlled Mode" anchor="orgf1e7716">
<t>With the congestion controlled mode, IP-TFS adapts to network
congestion by lowering the packet send rate to accommodate the
congestion. If congestion were handled in the network on a octet level
we might consider lowering the IPsec (encapsulation) packet size to
adapt; however, as congestion is normally handled in the network by
dropping packets we instead choose to lower the frequency we send our
fixed sized packets. This choice also minimizes transport overhead.</t>

<t>The output of a congestion control algorithm SHOULD adjust the
frequency that we send our packets until the congestion is
accommodated. We do not standardize the congestion control algorithm,
although the algorithm SHOULD conform to guidelines in <xref target="RFC2914"/>.</t>

<t>When an implementation is choosing a congestion control algorithm it
is worth noting that IP-TFS is not providing for reliable delivery of
IP traffic and so per packet ACKs are not required, and are not
provided.</t>

<t>It's perhaps important to note that the adjustable rate of sending
over the congestion controlled IP-TFS tunnel is being controlled by
the network congestion. As long as the encapsulated traffic flow
shape and timing are not directly affecting the network congestion,
the variations in the tunnel rate will not break the traffic flow
confidentiality.</t>

<section title="Circuit Breakers">
<t>In additional to congestion control, implementations may choose to
define and implement circuit breakers <xref target="RFC8084"/> as a recovery method
of last resort. Enabling circuit breakers is also a reason a user may
wish to enable congestion information reports even when using the
non-congestion controlled mode of operation. The definition of
circuit breakers are outside the scope of this document.</t>

</section>

</section>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Congestion Information" anchor="orgd619acc">
<t>In order to support the congestion control mode, we send regular
packet drop reports from the receiver (egress tunnel endpoint) to the
sender. These reports indicate the number of packet drops during a
sequence of packets. The sequence or range of packets is identified
using the start and end ESP sequence numbers of the packet range.</t>

<t>These congestion information reports can also be sent when in the
non-congestion controlled mode to allow for reporting from the
sending device or to implement Circuit Breakers <xref target="RFC8084"/>.</t>

<t>The congestion information is sent using an IKEv2 INFORMATION
notifications <xref target="RFC7296"/>. These notifications are sent at a configured
interval (which can be configured to 0 to disable the sending of the
reports).</t>

<section title="ECN Support" anchor="org3ad5aa9">
<t>In additional to normal packet loss information IP-TFS supports use
of the ECN bits in the encapsulating IP header <xref target="RFC3168"/> for
identifying congestion. If ECN use is enabled and a packet arrives at
the egress endpoint with the Congestion Experienced (CE) value set,
then the receiver records that packet as being dropped, although it
does not drop it. When the CE information is used to calculate the
packet drop count the receiver also sets the E bit in the congestion
information notification data. In order to respond quickly to the
congestion indication the receiver MAY immediately send a congestion
information notification to the sender upon receiving a packet with
the CE indication. This additional immediate send SHOULD only be done
once per normal congestion information sending interval though.</t>

<t>As noted in <xref target="RFC3168"/> the ECN bits are not protected by IPsec and
thus may constitute a covert channel. For this reason ECN use SHOULD
NOT be enabled by default.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Configuration" anchor="orgdb5a31e">
<t>IP-TFS is meant to be deployable with a minimal amount of
configuration. All IP-TFS specific configuration (i.e., in addition
to the underlying IPsec tunnel configuration) should be able to be
specified at the tunnel ingress (sending) side alone (i.e.,
single-ended provisioning).</t>

<section title="Bandwidth" anchor="orgc3d6e0c">
<t>Bandwidth is a local configuration option. For non-congestion
controlled mode the bandwidth SHOULD be configured. For
congestion controlled mode one can configure the bandwidth
or have no configuration and let congestion control discover the
maximum bandwidth available. No standardized configuration method is
required.</t>

</section>

<section title="Fixed Packet Size" anchor="org739333b">
<t>The fixed packet size to be used for the tunnel encapsulation packets
can be configured manually or can be automatically determined using
Path MTU discovery (see <xref target="RFC1191"/> and <xref target="RFC8201"/>). No standardized
configuration method is required.</t>

</section>

<section title="Congestion Information Configuration" anchor="org24d12cc">
<t>If congestion control mode is to be used, or if the user wishes to
receive congestion information on the sender for circuit breaking or
other operational notifications in the non-congestion controlled
mode, IP-TFS will need to configure the egress tunnel endpoint to
send congestion information periodically.</t>

<t>In order to configure the sending interval of periodic congestion
information on the egress tunnel endpoint, we utilize the IKEv2
Configuration Payload (CP) <xref target="RFC7296"/>. Implementations MAY also allow
for manual (or default) configuration of this interval; however,
implementations of IP-TFS MUST support configuration using the IKEv2
exchange described below.</t>

<t>We utilize a new IKEv2 configuration attribute TFS_INFO_INTERVAL
(TBD) to configure the sending interval from the egress endpoint of
the tunnel. This value is configured using a CFG_REQUEST payload and
is acknowledge by the receiver using a CFG_REPLY payload. This
configuration exchange SHOULD be sent during the IKEv2 configuration
exchanges occurring as the tunnel is first brought up. The sending
interval value MAY also be changed at any time afterwards using a
similar CFG_REQUEST/CFG_REPLY payload inside an IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL
exchange.</t>

<t>In the absence of a congestion information configuration exchange
the sending interval is up to the receiving device configuration.</t>

<t>The sending interval value is given in milliseconds and is 16 bits
wide; however, it is not recommended that values below 1/10th of a
second are used as this could lead to early exhaustion of the Message
ID field used in the IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL exchange to send the
congestion information.</t>

<t>{{question: Could we get away with sending the info using the same
message ID each time? We have a timestamp that would allow for
duplicate detection, and the payload will be authenticated by IKEv2.
}}</t>

<t>A sending interval value of 0 disables sending of the congestion
information.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="org52be64c">
<t>This document describes a mechanism to add Traffic Flow
Confidentiality to IP traffic. Use of this mechanism is expected to
increase the security of the traffic being transported. Other than
the additional security afforded by using this mechanism, IP-TFS
utilizes the security protocols <xref target="RFC4303"/> and <xref target="RFC7296"/> and so their
security considerations apply to IP-TFS as well.</t>

<t>As noted previously in <xref target="orgf1e7716"/>, for TFC to be
fully maintained the encapsulated traffic flow should not be
affecting network congestion in a predictable way, and if it would be
then non-congestion controlled mode use should be considered instead.</t>
