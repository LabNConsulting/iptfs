* yang-org-make

This is a repo to track a common sub-makefile for authors of YANG modules that
utilize ~org-rfc~.

If you find this file inside a sub-directory of a YANG project, it has probably
been included into the project using ~git subtree~. You can safely ignore this
~README.org~ file, and just know that the module developers are taking advantage
of ~git subtree~ to track changes to the included ~yang.mk~

If you're a YANG module author using ~org-rfc~ and you'd like to contribute back
changes to ~yang.mk~, please submit a PR for changes to the ~yang-org-make~
project.

** YANG module authors

If you are creating a new YANG project using ~org-rfc~ you should include this
project using ~git subtree~ using the following commands (using a suggested
"prefix" of "mk").

#+begin_src shell
git remote add -f mk-upstream https://github.com/choppsv1/yang-org-make.git
git subtree add --prefix mk mk-upstream master --squash
#+end_src

Now your top level ~Makefile~ would simply be:

#+begin_src makefile
ORG := my-new-module.org
include mk/yang.mk
#+end_src
